<p><h3><i>
    Kolkata Knight Riders entered the IPL 2025 auction with 51 crore as the remaining purse amount. They had retained six players in the form of Rinku Singh, Varun Chakravarthy, Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Harshit Rana, and Ramandeep Singh. They had no option of using RTM card, with the core players group setup, KKR just needed those apprentices who were not heavy on their wallets and could do the job. 

The IPL 2024 champions shopped seven players at the auction on the first day. They showed faith in their veteran player, Venkatesh Iyer as they splurged 23.75 crore on the Southpaw. They got back their nurtured youngsters in the form of Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Angkrish Raghuvanshi.

They entered the second day with 10.05 crore in their purse invested in both all-rounders and strengthened their bowling attack. The likes of Rovaman Powell and Spencer Johnson will don the purple jersey and Manish Pandey will make a comeback to KKR camp in IPL 2025.
