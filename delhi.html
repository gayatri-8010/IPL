<p><h3><i>
    It was going to be an interesting mega auction for the Delhi Capitals, who retained only four players of theirs ahead of the showpiece event in Jeddah. What added more spice to the occasion was the team management letting go of their skipper Rishabh Pant. 

    KL Rahul was one of the most distinguished buyers at the auction, especially after the management did not exercise their Right To Match card for Pant. Two other prolific batters who could quite potentially be utilized as openers were Jake Fraser-McGurk, who was bought back, and Faf du Plessis, who was dropped out of the plans of the Royal Challengers Bengaluru. Karun Nair, who has not featured in the previous two editions, was secured for INR 50 lakh.
