<p><h3><i>
    Franchise Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) made headlines on Day 1 of the IPL 2025 Mega Auction in Jeddah, shattering records with their historic INR 27 crore acquisition of the ravishing wicketkeeper-batter, Rishabh Pant. This highest bid in IPL history, surpassed Mitchell Starc's previous record of INR 24.75 crore.

    The franchise, already consisting of Nicholas Pooran as one of their retained players, showed clear interest in building a leadership core. LSG's purchases continued with the acquisition of international talents David Miller, Mitchell Marsh, and Aiden Markram, all bringing valuable captaincy experience to the table.
    
    The side also secured fast bowler Avesh Khan for INR 9.75 crore, while also adding big hitter Abdul Samad and young talent Aryan Juyal to their roster. Looking ahead to Day 2, LSG entered with a remaining purse of INR 14.85 crore and a minimum of six slots to fill. Owner Sanjiv Goenka had earlier indicated the team's focus will be on strengthening their death overs batting and spin department. With one Right to Match (RTM) card still in hand and multiple slots to fill, LSG will look to make good use of it.
