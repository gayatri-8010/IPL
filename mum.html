<p><h3><i>Mumbai Indians (MI) retained five capped players - Hardik Pandya, Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, and Tilak Varma ahead of the IPL 2025 mega auction. They were left with a purse of 45 crore heading into the first day of the auction in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on Sunday, November 24.

    The former five-time champions roped in only four players on the first day of the IPL 2025 auction. They had to wait for nearly five hours before they could celebrate a new signing as they opened their account by bringing back star New Zealand seamer Trent Boult for a whopping INR 12.50 crore. Mumbai Indians went on to re-sign explosive Punjab batter Naman Dhir for INR 5.25 crore.
