<p><h3><i>
    Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) appeared as one of the most aggressive bidders on Day 1 of the IPL 2025 auction in Jeddah, making some big purchases to strengthen their squad despite a limited purse.

    The 2016 champions made their intent clear by securing wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan for a substantial INR 11.25 crore, their highest purchase of the day. The franchise also strengthened its bowling attack by acquiring veteran pacer Mohammed Shami for INR 10 crore after an intense bidding war involving multiple teams.
    
    SRH further enhanced their bowling arsenal by adding Harshal Patel and spinner Rahul Chahar. The team also secured the services of Australian spinner Adam Zampa and domestic talents like Abhinav Manohar and Atharva Taide for good prizes, respectively.
    
    With only INR 5.15 crore remaining in their purse and a minimum of five slots to fill, SRH faced a tough Day 2 at the auction. The former champions were looking silent during the initial phases of the second day of the mega-auctions. The side made some strategic calls by adding domestic talents to their squad.
