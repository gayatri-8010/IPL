    <H1>Punjab Kings (PBKS) IPL Squad 2025</H1>

<p><h3><i>
    Punjab Kings was one of the most active sides across the two days of the IPL 2025 mega auction. The side came into the auction with the biggest purse of them all, as they had only retained two of their stars from the previous season. 

    Having to rebuild most of their squad from scratch, Punjab Kings made the most of their money and managed to rope in some big names. The side kicked off the proceedings by using the RTM card of Arshdeep Singh and roping in Shreyas Iyer for a whopping INR 26.75 crore. 
    
    Furthermore, the side also bought Yuzvendra Chahal, Marcus Stoinis, Glenn Maxwell, and many more big names in the mega auction ahead of the new season. Still in search of their maiden IPL title, Punjab will hope that a revamped squad will help them reach ever closer to a title. 
    
    The side will also have to decide who will lead them in the new season of the IPL. With Shreyas Iyer being the marquee signing, it is expected that the former KKR leader could take the reins in Punjab Kings as well.
