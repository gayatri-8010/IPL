<p><h3><i>
    Chennai Super Kings (CSK) assembled a formidable team at the IPL 2025 mega auction in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia as they set their sights on a record sixth title.

    On the first day of the IPL 2025 auction on Sunday, November 24, the former five-time champions started proceeding by bringing back Devon Conway for INR 6.25 crore. The New Zealand wicketkeeper-batter joined MS Dhoni, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Ravindra Jadeja, Shivam Dube, and Matheesha Pathirana, who were retained ahead of the auction.
    
    CSK bolstered their batting further by adding the aggressive duo of Rachin Ravindra and Rahul Tripathi for INR 4 crore and 3.40 crore, respectively. However, the biggest highlight for the Ruturaj-led side on Day 1 was the homecoming of Ravichandran Ashwin. The veteran off-spinner reunited with the Men in Yellow after a decade for INR 9.75 crore.
    
    CSK's highest successful bid on Sunday was for Afghanistan spinner Noor Ahmad. They secured the services of the youngster for a whopping INR 10 crore. Meanwhile, left-arm seamer Khaleel Ahmed was signed for INR 4.80, which can be termed as one of the steals of the event.
