<p><h3><i>
    After the Gujarat Titans retained their top-order batters, Shubman Gill and Sai Sudharsan, on the Deadline Day on October 31, along with Rashid Khan, who was retained at a whopping INR 18 crore, it was expected that they would want to bring in firepower in both batting and bowling. 

This is exactly what the title-winners in their inaugural edition (2022) did at the mega auction for the IPL 2025. With the Rajasthan Royals letting go of Jos Buttler, the Titans pounced onto him for INR 15.75 crore. Anuj Rawat and the young Kumar Kushagra were also roped into the setup to provide enough padding.
