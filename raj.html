    <H1>Rajasthan Royals (RR) IPL Squad 2025</H1>

<p><h3><i>
    The IPL 2025 auction proved to be quite a fruitful one for the inaugural champions Rajasthan Royals. The side came into the event having retained six players; the side had no RTM cards available in the event as a result.

    Royals came into the auction with INR 41 crore remaining in their purse, and the side managed to rope in some stars towards the latter stages of the first day. The Royals roped in the likes of Maheesh Theekshana, Wanindu Hasaranga, Jofra Archer, and many more. 
    
    
    Under the leadership of Sanju Samson, Rajasthan Royals retained most of their core ahead of the IPL 2025, and they will hope that with the addition of Nitish Rana, Theekshana, and many more stars in the squad, 2025 will be the year that brings them their second IPL title. 
    
    The side managed to reach the summit clash of the IPL 2022, failed to make it to the knockout rounds in 2023, and reached very close in 2024. Under the new head coach, Rahul Dravid, Royals will hope for significant improvement.
