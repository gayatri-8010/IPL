    <H1>Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) IPL Squad 2025</H1>

<p><h3><i>
    Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) entered the IPL 2025 auction with the second-highest purse amount of 83 crore for them to shop for the desired player. But the franchise did show the intent to go big for some players, but the think tanks had other plans midway. The rumour about KL Rahulâ€™s potential comeback was put to rest as he joined Delhi Capitals with RCB resting their paddle at 10.75 crore bid. The management had stated that the motive ahead of auctions is to strengthen the Indian core. 

    They got uncapped bowlers Jitesh Sharma, Rasikh Dar Salam and Suyash Sharma on Day 1. The fact that they lacked their preferred bowling setup from eons, the damage control was palpable with the signings of Dar and Suyash. 
    
    With a 30.65 crore purse remaining on the second day, the Bengaluru-based franchises focussed on a mixture of all-rounders, both batting and bowling-oriented. Tim David was their best pick of the day as he will assume services with RCB for just 3 crore. Also, the experienced pacer, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, will don the red jersey in IPL 2025.
